Had an incredible time participating in the Battlefield of Things IoT hashtag#hackathon hosted by Belgian Defence over the weekend. Tasked with the challenge of surveilling a large area using low-power, secure and easily deployable devices, we set off to develop a solution within 48 hours.
 
Our team rose to the challenge by engineering an encrypted mesh network of sensor nodes utilizing hashtag#LoRa radio modules for long range transmission over multiple kilometers, facilitated by ESP32 microcontrollers. Each node was armed with a GPS module and a suite of sensors, empowering us to detect and localize human presence at a very low cost. ðŸ“¡ðŸ—º
