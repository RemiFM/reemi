A radio-controlled vehicle with a flat top has been designed for use in robotics projects. The initial application involves autonomously landing a drone on the RC vehicle while it is in motion.

The vehicle is powered by VRLA gel batteries, chosen for their durability given that the vehicle will not undergo frequent charge/discharge cycles. It is equipped with an onboard charging module, allowing the vehicle to be conveniently charged by plugging it into a standard wall socket. A NUC PC and a 5G router are integrated, enabling a wide range of programmable tasks on the RC vehicle.
