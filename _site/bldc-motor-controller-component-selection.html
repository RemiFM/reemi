  <h1>BLDC Motor Controller: Component Selection</h1>

  <blockquote>
  <p>This article is <strong>part 1</strong> of a series in which I will track my progress in the creation of a STM32-based ESC motor controller. The board will be designed to test various (sensorless) motor control algorithms like <strong>6-step</strong> control and <strong>FOC</strong> (field-oriented control).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I defined the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3-5S</strong> LiPo input (11.1-21V)</li>
  <li><strong>45A</strong> continuous current</li>
  <li>Current &amp; voltage sensing on all phases + Back-EMF sensing</li>
  <li>CAN, USB, &amp; hall sensor interfaces (+ maybe I2C/SPI/UART)</li>
  <li>6-layer board, 2oz on outer layers, 0.5oz on inner layers</li>
  <li>Minimal form factor, majority of components on top layer</li>
</ul>

<p>Some interesting resources I found and will consult during the design are the <a href="https://github.com/vedderb/bldc-hardware">open source VESC project</a> and the STMicroelectronics <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-g431b-esc1.html">B-G431B-ESC1 discovery kit</a>. Both have detailed schematics and documentation available.</p>

<h2 id="microcontroller">Microcontroller</h2>
<p>For the brains of the ESC, I chose a microcontroller from the <strong>STM32G4</strong> series by STMicroelectronics. These MCUs are designed with motor control and digital power applications in mind, offering a solid blend of performance and analog capability.</p>

<p>Specifically, I went with the <strong>STM32G431CB.</strong>* It’s an entry-level chip that brings together a Cortex-M4 core with DSP and floating-point unit (FPU) support—handy for fast real-time calculations. One of the key reasons for this choice was its rich set of analog features: it includes three 12-bit ADCs and four programmable op-amps, which are perfect for precise current shunt measurements.</p>

<h2 id="mosfets--gate-drivers">MOSFETs &amp; Gate Drivers</h2>
<p>When it came to selecting the power stage components, I focused on finding MOSFETs with high current handling, low on-resistance, and a comfortable voltage margin. Since the ESC is designed to operate at a maximum voltage of around 21V, I wanted components that could easily withstand voltage spikes and transients. I settled on the <strong>STL225N6F7AG</strong>, a <strong>60V</strong>, <strong>120A</strong> MOSFET with a very low <strong>1.2 mΩ</strong> R<sub>DS(on)</sub>. These specs provide plenty of headroom while keeping conduction losses to a minimum.</p>

<p>For the gate drivers, I chose to use <strong>three individual half-bridge drivers</strong> instead of a single integrated three-phase driver. This might seem unconventional, but it offers a significant layout advantage: it allows me to place each driver closer to its corresponding MOSFET pair, which gives a bit more flexibility in routing. I picked the <strong>L6388E</strong> which is rated for 600V and has 400mA source current and 650mA sink current capabality.</p>

<h2 id="power-control">Power Control</h2>
<p>A <strong>L7986</strong>-based buck regulator will converter the input battery voltage to a stable 10V reference. The 10V is used directly by the gate drivers, and is reduced to 5V and 3.3V by <strong>LDFPVR</strong> linear regulators.</p>

<p>There is also a USB-C 2.0 receptacle on the board which is able to communicate with the MUC &amp; power the peripherals (5V &amp; 3.3V) when no battery is connected. The <strong>TPS2116</strong>, a low IQ power multiplexer is used to switch between USB power and battery power, prioritizing the battery power if available.</p>

<h2 id="sensing">Sensing</h2>
<p>The <strong>current</strong> is measured in each phase of the motor controller by using a low-side shunt resistor of 2mΩ in each half-bridge. Two current shunts would be sufficient (sum of phase currents equals 0), but this allows for higher accuracy. The internal op-amps of the MCU are used to amplify the measurement. The <strong>voltage</strong> of each motor phase and the battery voltage is measured using a simple resistor divider.</p>

<p>Measuring the <strong>back-EMF</strong> is interesting for sensorless control as it is directly related to the rotor’s position and speed, and can thus be used to determine the commutation sequence. In application notes, I found an interesting schematic which allows the back-EMF to be measured in two modes. Either at the end of PWM at low duty cycles (low speeds), or during the PWM at higher duty cycles (high speeds).</p>

<h2 id="can-interface">CAN Interface</h2>
<p>A <strong>TCAN330</strong> transceiver module is used to enable the CAN peripheral. A fuse is included to protect the connected bus if anything were to go wrong with the motor controller. The circuit accepts also the supply voltage from the external unit. A terminator reistor of 120Ω can be enabled or disabled by the MCU by integrating a digital SPDT switch.</p>

<p>That’s it for the most important components on the board. The full schematics will be made available on GitHub soon.</p>
