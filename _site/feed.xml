&lt;p&gt;This weekend I participated in the &lt;strong&gt;Battlefield of Things Hackathon - Drone Edition&lt;/strong&gt;. An event organised by the Belgian Defence for defence personnel, industry experts, drone enthusiasts, researchers and students. The event is a unique opportunity to work on drone hardware and software and tackle real-world challenges proposed by Belgian Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the presented challenges was drone navigation in &lt;strong&gt;GNSS- and RF- denied&lt;/strong&gt; regions, necessary due to advancements in jamming technologies. This made me think of the American &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theseus.us/&quot;&gt;Theseus Drone&lt;/a&gt; which inspired me to approach the challenge in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach&quot;&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following methods could be used or combined to measure relative movement of the UAV:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMU&lt;/strong&gt; - Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Magnetometer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optical Flow&lt;/strong&gt; - A downwards facing camera tracks features, and calculates how the pixels are moved between frames. When the orientation and height above the surface is known, the absolure displacement can be calculated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stereo camera&lt;/strong&gt; - Using two downward facing camera’s, accurate depth measurements and 3D perception can be created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sattelite imagery&lt;/strong&gt; - Sattelite images could be stored in the drone, and be compared to the video stream of the downward camera. This way, sensor drift from the methods above could be reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/projects/hackathon2/visual_odometry.png&quot; alt=&quot;orangepi&quot; class=&quot;ioda&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not going to be able to tackle all this in just 24 hours, but I brought some hardware and started working. I used an Orange Pi 5 Plus SBC which has a Rockchip CPU and a 6Tops NPU. I also brought and implemented a OV13850 13MP camera module and a LSM9DS0 iMU module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/projects/hackathon2/visual_odometry.gif&quot; alt=&quot;odometry&quot; class=&quot;ioda&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I build a Flask webpage running on the SBC, and used OpenCV to recognize features in an image and track their relative movement between frames. From the GIF above it is clear that this tracking did not seem to work very well, and required more tuning (number of tracking points, feature treshold..) to improve it. Another difficulty was the depth/height estimation, as I did not have sensors for this, thus a constant height was assumed, not very accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had good fun creating this, even though the position estimation is far from reality. I might try to improve it at home, running more advanced SLAM algorithms which I hope do a better job than my own attempted 2D visual odometry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting resources I will consult during the design are the open source VESC project and the STMicroelectronics B-G431B-ESC1 discovery kit. Both have detailed schematics and documentation available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schematic is based around the &lt;strong&gt;STM32G4&lt;/strong&gt; microcontroller, mixed-signal MCU’s with DSP and FPU instructions aimed at motor control and digital power applications. Three single half-bridge drivers are used instead of a single three-phase driver to benefit the layout of the board. The STL225N6F7AG &lt;strong&gt;60V, 120A MOSFET&lt;/strong&gt; with an on-resistance of 1.2mOhm is used.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I ran into a dilemma. Initially I wanted to have small SMT components on both sides of the final PCB assembly. But since I will be the one assembling the board, this might not be the best idea. I have decided the majority of components will come on a single side of the board making the result a bit larger than initially expected. This choice will help me keep my sanity during assembly and troubleshooting. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boards were ordered from JLCPCB, and the assembly was done &lt;strong&gt;manually&lt;/strong&gt; using a hot plate and a rework station. I used STM32CubeIDE and the HAL provided by the manufacturer for writing the firmware. For the OLED display, I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306&quot;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; which works with OLEDs based on SSD1306 driver. The nRF24 driver required more work, and is being constructed step by step. A state machine is running in the main loop, different functionalities can be chosen by using the push buttons on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike traditional drones that rely on onboard batteries, tethered drones are connected to a ground station via a physical tether, enabling &lt;strong&gt;continuous operation while maintaining a secure and interference-resistant data link&lt;/strong&gt;. These systems are increasingly popular in security and surveillance applications, offering real-time aerial monitoring without the risk of signal interception or limited flight time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent project, I explored &lt;strong&gt;low-cost solutions&lt;/strong&gt; for tethered drones by looking into different electrical architectures. The goal was to determine the feasibility of drone systems that provide reliable power and communication while maintaining affordability and scalability for diverse use cases. In particular we compared both &lt;strong&gt;AC tether&lt;/strong&gt; systems and &lt;strong&gt;high voltage DC tether&lt;/strong&gt; systems, in both centralized and distributed power topologies. I created PCB modules for the different topologies. Communication signals were transmitted over the same lines used to deliver power, utilizing &lt;strong&gt;signal superposition&lt;/strong&gt; to combine both functionalities within a single tether.&lt;/p&gt;

Factors such as water ingress, punctures, ruptures, or structural damage to cables can significantly impact their performance. During the design phase, vehicle engineers struggle to &lt;strong&gt;identify potential failure points or weak spots in the wire harness&lt;/strong&gt;. For maintenance technicians, locating broken wire segments or loose connections is a time-consuming task, often necessitating the replacement of the entire harness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, I developed hardware that periodically performs &lt;strong&gt;time-domain reflectometry (TDR)&lt;/strong&gt; measurements on multiple signal lines within the wire harness. TDR enables vehicle owners to visualize the impedance of the wires, making it possible to detect performance issues at specific locations. The hardware is installed between the vehicle’s main computer and the wire harness and is capable of isolating individual signal lines for measurement. The system automatically runs diagnostics during the vehicle’s startup and shutdown processes. Multiplexers are employed to switch between signal lines, directing them to the TDR measurement device. Measurements are stored in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Remi De Coster</name></author><category term="example" /><summary type="html">Agricultural vehicles often face wire harness issues due to the harsh environments in which they operate.

Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.casadi.org/&quot;&gt;CasADi&lt;/a&gt; framework non-linear optimization within Python, I created a web tool which can be used to design an optimal hybrid battery system, minimizing either the total cost, volume or weight.

To effectively leverage this technology, it is essential to have a reliable infrastructure for real-time data monitoring and communication. For research purposes, we have a greenhouse setup where new algorithms, hardware, and software can be tested and refined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/projects/greenhouse/greenhouse2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;greenhouse&quot; class=&quot;ioda&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support these operations, I designed a power system that ensures constant availability of both internet connectivity and 230VAC power within the greenhouse. This system utilizes a 4G router for seamless internet access and a solar panel to sustainably provide energy, ensuring the greenhouse remains operational without relying on an external power grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system also integrates a single-board computer housed in the electrical cabinet, which hosts a Flask web page to monitor the greenhouse’s status. Key environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and live camera feeds, are continuously updated and accessible remotely. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis, facilitating the development and testing of autonomous drone applications in agricultural settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had an incredible time participating in the Battlefield of Things IoT hashtag#hackathon hosted by Belgian Defence over the weekend. Tasked with the challenge of surveilling a large area using low-power, secure and easily deployable devices, we set off to develop a solution within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team rose to the challenge by engineering an encrypted mesh network of sensor nodes utilizing hashtag#LoRa radio modules for long range transmission over multiple kilometers, facilitated by ESP32 microcontrollers. Each node was armed with a GPS module and a suite of sensors, empowering us to detect and localize human presence at a very low cost. 📡🗺&lt;/p&gt;
