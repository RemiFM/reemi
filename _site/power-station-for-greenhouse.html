  <h1>Power Station For Greenhouse</h1>

  <p>Autonomous drones hold significant potential in agricultural applications, such as flower counting, yield estimation, scarecrow functionality, and disease detection. To effectively leverage this technology, it is essential to have a reliable infrastructure for real-time data monitoring and communication. For research purposes, we have a greenhouse setup where new algorithms, hardware, and software can be tested and refined.</p>

<p>To support these operations, I designed a power system that ensures constant availability of both internet connectivity and 230VAC power within the greenhouse. This system utilizes a 4G router for seamless internet access and a solar panel to sustainably provide energy, ensuring the greenhouse remains operational without relying on an external power grid.</p>

<p>The system also integrates a single-board computer housed in the electrical cabinet, which hosts a Flask web page to monitor the greenhouseâ€™s status. Key environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and live camera feeds, are continuously updated and accessible remotely. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis, facilitating the development and testing of autonomous drone applications in agricultural settings.</p>
