  <h1>Radio Controlled Development Vehicle</h1>

  <p>A radio-controlled vehicle with a flat top has been designed for use in robotics projects. The initial application involves <strong>autonomously landing a drone on the RC vehicle while it is in motion</strong>.</p>

<p>The vehicle is powered by valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) gel batteries, chosen for their durability given that the vehicle will not undergo frequent charge/discharge cycles. It is equipped with an onboard charging module, allowing the vehicle to be conveniently charged by plugging it into a standard wall socket. A NUC PC and a 5G router are integrated, enabling a wide range of programmable tasks on the RC vehicle.</p>
